For banks with a single teller, obviously it doesn't matter whether you use a single queue
or multi queue for the bank, and all of the statistics for each method are identical.
However, when you increase the teller size to 2, you can see that the average wait for a
customer is slightly lower for the single queue bank (.36) than the multi queue bank (.43).
This trend continues as you increase the amount of tellers at the bank to 3, with values of 
.39 and .54, respectively, for the single queue and multi queue. However, then trend reverses
with teller amounts of 4 and 5. So, in conclusion, whether a single queue or multi queue is
better depends on the amount of tellers. A single queue is better for 2 or 3 tellers, while
a multi queue is better for 4 or 5.

avg wait times for single queue banks:
2 tellers = .36
3 tellers = .3988
4 tellers = .44
5 tellers = .48

avg wait times for multi queue banks:
2 tellers = .43
3 tellers = .54
4 tellers = .41
5 tellers = .42

I think 2 tellers is optimal for my bank. While the single queue for 2 tellers is better than
the multi queue, the 2 tellers option has the lowest overall wait times for both bank types.
If you were looking for the fastest multi queue option, then I would recommend having 4
tellers. I listed the average wait times above, so you can see the numbers I'm using to
justify my answers.
