For storing my user history, I decided to simply use a standard
Java LinkedList. The reason I did this is because of its fast 
runtime of O(1) for inserts, which was the main operation I did.
Furthermore, with the way I displayed the predictions, it 
required me to do pretty much no work to keep the user history in
order of most-recently-used. Additionally, it's very easy to 
iterate through a LinkedList with a for-each loop, and it's 
simple to use and understand in general.
