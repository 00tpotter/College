My jumping is a bit wonky. You can't initiate a new jump while a platform isn't under you,
but if you hold the up arrow you can still pause the jump mid-air. This doesn't necessarily
break the jumping rules described in the directions, but it's not perfect.
Furthermore, I didn't realize that displaying text on the screen in display.asm is set by 
default to have white text and a black background, so I changed the values I needed to invert
that and make it more readable on my board that has a white background. So, if you're running it
and the lose game or win game text looks weird, make sure it's running with my version of display.asm
Also, you can stand on top of enemies without taking damage. This is not a bug.
Otherwise, everything seems to be working on my machine.
Sometimes, if there is flickering in MARS, certain aspects about collision and such can get wonky,
but with the new version of MARS it should be fine.
